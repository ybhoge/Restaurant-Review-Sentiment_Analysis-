# Restaurant_Review-Sentiment_Analysis
   Sentiment Analysis: It is the interpretation and classification of emotions (positive, negative) within text data using text analysis techniques. Sentiment analysis allows organizations to identify public sentiment towards certain words or topics.

In this Project, we'll develop a Sentiment Analysis model to categorize a resturant reviews as Positive or Negative.
   The main motive behind this project is to classify whether the given feedback or review in textual context is positive or negative. Reviews can be given to the model and it classifies the review as a negative review or a positive. This shows the satisfaction of the customer or the experience the customer has experienced.

# Dataset

Review: The reviews on resturants were in the Review Column.

Liked: The Good and Bad Review are denoted in the Liked column in the form of 0 and 1

0- Bad Review

1- Good Review

#  Creating Bag of Word model(BoW)
   The bag-of-words model is a way of representing text data when modeling text with machine learning algorithms.

# Model 
1)Supprt vector Machine(SVM)

2)Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Then, check that Review is correctly predicted or not.

# Extra Work
   Different classifier models can also be tested.

   But, The remaining two models can be tuned for better results.

# Conclusion
